joost item ports.
porting my favorite items from joostmod to 1.4 because i dont know if the guy who made joost is ever going to do anything
crafting recipes are changed cause idk if i will be bothered to add bosses
Has not been tested extensively on multiplayer, so tell us about bugs (which we may or may not fix) on the steam page :))

Items ported:

    Cactus Juice
    Joost Juice
    Focus Souls
    Brawlers Glove (its buggy af, may cause crashes :D)
    Tome of Manipulation/Greater Manipulation (kinda buggy in multiplayer)
    Hundred/Thousand Needles
    Needle Wrath
    Cactus Worm Hook
    Doom Cannon
    Some Fishing Shotguns

Changes from 1.3:

Tome of Greater Manipulation

    Now works with pvp :)
    still a cheat item, be nice with your friends

Hundred/Thousand Needles

    they bounce

Brawlers Glove

    now with more bugs!!!
    entirely reworked ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    but still makes u faster based on ur knockback (so have fun with knockback increasing stuff like fire gauntlet/titan potion)

Cactus Worm Hook

    Faster (its really fast)
    Light on the end of the Hook
    More Range (basically to the edge of the screen)

Doom Cannon

    Charges twice as fast (5 seconds i think)
    Less Damage, Slower Projectile (except final big one)
    Stats on huge skull shot (60 * 3.5 = 210 damage, 7 speed - whatever that means)

Mechanical Fishing Shotgun

    less damage (16 per bobber)
