# joostitemport
joost item ports.

porting my favorite items from joostmod to 1.4 because i dont know if the guy who made joost is ever going to do anything

Has not been tested extensively on multiplayer, so tell us about bugs (which we may or may not fix) on the steam page. :))

Items ported:
- Cactus Juice
- Joost Juice
- Focus Souls
- Brawlers Glove (its buggy af, may cause crashes :D)
- Tome of Manipulation/Greater Manipulation (kinda buggy in multiplayer)
- Hundred/Thousand Needles
- Needle Wrath
- Cactus Worm Hook
- Doom Cannon
- Some Fishing Shotguns

Changes from 1.3:
**Tome of Greater Manipulation**
- Now works with pvp :)
- still a cheat item, be nice with your friends
**Hundred/Thousand Needles**
- they bounce
**Brawlers Glove**
- now with more bugs!!!
- entirely reworked  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
**Cactus Worm Hook**
- Faster (its really fast)
- Light on the end of the Hook (around 10 tiles)
- More Range (1000 tiles: basically to the edge of the screen)
**Doom Cannon**
- Charges twice as fast (5 seconds i think)
- Less Damage, Slower Projectile (except final big one)
- Stats on huge skull shot (60 * 3.5 = 210 damage, 7 speed - whatever that means)
**Mechanical Fishing Shotgun**
- less damage (16 per bobber)
